# Telecopter

Telecopter is an asynchronous Telegram bot designed to streamline media requests. Users can search for movies and TV shows, submit requests, and track their status. Administrators have a dedicated panel to manage incoming requests, approve new users, and broadcast messages.

## ‚úÖ Features

### For Users

  - **Search Media**: Search for movies and TV shows using TMDB's API.
  - **Submit Requests**: Request media with the option to add personal notes.
  - **Manual Requests**: If media isn't found, users can submit a manual request with a description.
  - **Request History**: View a personal history of all submitted requests and their current status (e.g., Pending, Approved, Completed).
  - **Problem Reporting**: Report issues directly to administrators.
  - **Access Control**: New users must request access and be approved by an administrator before they can use the bot.

### For Admins

  - **Admin Panel**: A central dashboard to access all administrative functions.
  - **Task Management**: View a paginated list of all pending requests and problem reports from users.
  - **Request Moderation**: Approve, deny, or mark requests as complete. Admins can also add notes to their actions, which are visible to the user.
  - **User Management**: View a list of users pending approval and approve or reject their access requests.
  - **Broadcast System**: Send custom messages to all approved users of the bot, with options for muted or un-muted notifications.
